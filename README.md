This repo provides the boilerplate code to create a web app with a React-based frontend and a Node-based backend. It is the accumulation of many projects worth of insights, frustration, and research.

In particular, some notable features are:

- Typescript for both frontend and backend.
- Modular server and client sub-repos.
- React with Material UI & JSS.
- Redux organized by state modules.
- Express.js API/prod server with REST and SocketIO communication.
- Opinionated code formatter for JS/TS/TSX and Python.
